This repository contains scripts and command lines used to produce a phylogeny and detect homoplasic SNPs in SARS-CoV-2. It has been used in the publication

In the context of the publication, the main dataset under study comprises several thousands *de novo* assembled genomes. In order to validate both the homoplasies (a) and the topology of the main phylogeny (b), a subset of these genomes also available as raw sequencing data were also analyzed.

This pipeline takes as input the raw sequencing reads (fastq) of 348 SARS-CoV-2 isolates and outputs a set of SNP and nucleotides alignements.

The script 'Main.sh" is to be run in a unix command line step by step to ensure proper functioning.
You are likely to have to make some modifications to it in order to modify paths etc.

## Inputs (not provided)
- A fasta reference genome to be put in a folder named 00.ref
- Fastq files containing raw sequencing reads to be put in a folder named 01.sra_fastq

## Outputs (not provided)
