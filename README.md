This pipeline takes as input the raw sequencing reads (fastq) of 348 SARS-CoV-2 isolates and outputs a set of SNP and nucleotides alignements.

In the context of the publication, phylogenies are produced and homoplasies are identified.

The script 'Main.sh" is to be run in a unix command line step by step to ensure proper functioning.
You are likely to have to make some modifications to it in order to modify paths etc.

## Inputs (not provided)
- A fasta reference genome to be put in a folder named 00.ref
