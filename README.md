# SARS-CoV-2 SNP Calling pipeline

This repository contains scripts and command line used for the publication "to be added".

It takes as input the raw sequencing reads (fastq) of 348 SARS-CoV-2 isolates and outputs a set of SNP and nucleotides alignements.

In the context of the publication, phylogenies are produced and homoplasies are identified.

The script 'Main.sh" is to be run in a unix command line step by step to ensure proper functioning.
You are likely to have to make some modifications to it in order to modify paths etc.

## Inputs (not provided)
- A fasta reference genome to be put in a folder named 00.ref
- Fastq files containing raw sequencing reads to be put in a folder named 01.sra_fastq


This Readme file will be edited and completed more thoroughly in the days to come.
